# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning application that predicts whether a loan application is likely to be **Approved** or **Rejected** based on applicant information. The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, feature analysis, handling class imbalance using **SMOTE**, training multiple classification models, model evaluation, and selecting the best-performing model.

The project was developed and evaluated entirely in **Google Colab** using Python and the Scikit-learn ecosystem.

## 📌 Overview

Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications every day. Evaluating each application manually is time-consuming and may lead to inconsistent decisions.

This project uses Machine Learning techniques to automate the loan approval process by analyzing applicant information and predicting whether a loan should be approved. Multiple classification algorithms were trained and compared, with **Random Forest** achieving the best overall performance.
